/**
 * The cash in the safe on the pump site.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR. Money physically kept on site, in notes: the day's takings
 * before they are banked, cash lent to people and taken back, cash handed to a
 * supplier against a purchase code, and a working float for whatever the pump
 * needs paying for that hour. None of it is in the banking system, so nothing
 * else in this app knows about it - before this page the only record was an
 * Excel sheet called "Tajori" with five columns, and the balance in it was a
 * formula nobody could check without opening the file.
 *
 * IT IS THAT SHEET, IN THE SAME ORDER, WITH THE SAME RUNNING BALANCE. That is
 * deliberate down to the column headings: the owner has read this layout every
 * day for months and the app's job is to stop him needing the laptop, not to
 * teach him a new way to look at his own money. What it adds is the three
 * things the spreadsheet could not do - a balance he can trust because a
 * database computed it, a picture of the week, and a reason on every line that
 * can be added up.
 *
 * Owner only, like Banking and Expenses. This is his own cash.
 */
/*
 * THE BALANCE COLUMN IS PINNED.
 *
 * `RegisterTable` established the pattern (see "A table too wide to read: pin
 * the ends, scroll the middle" in docs/UI_CONVENTIONS.md) and pins BOTH ends.
 * This table pins one, deliberately. The register's middle is eight columns
 * wide, so two pinned ends still leave something worth scrolling; this one's
 * middle is four, and at 400px a second pinned column would leave about 140px
 * of scrollport for a reason, an amount in and an amount out — which is the
 * "at 400px the pinned columns are very nearly the whole table" failure the
 * register wrote down, arrived at from the other direction.
 *
 * So the right-hand end is pinned and the reason column scrolls. The balance
 * is what this page exists to show — it is the column the owner kept the
 * spreadsheet for — and it was off the right-hand edge on a phone before this.
 *
 * (The DATE column that used to lead this table is gone entirely: a page is
 * one day now, so every row shared it and it belonged in the heading. That
 * bought back about 110px, which is why the middle can afford to scroll.)
 *
 * THE BALANCE AND THE DELETE BUTTON SHARE ONE CELL, and that is not tidiness.
 * As two pinned cells the outer one needs `right: <width of everything right
 * of it>`, which the convention warns about in as many words — and the number
 * was wrong: the action column is 3rem of button plus the `.td` padding, so it
 * renders at 68px, and offsetting the balance by 3rem painted the last 8px of
 * every figure underneath it. `Rs 1,781,910` lost its last digit on a phone
 * and the DOM check said nothing, because the text was not overflowing its own
 * box — another cell was simply on top of it. One cell at `right: 0` has no
 * offset to get wrong.
 *
 * It also keeps the delete button reachable. Pinned alone at `right: 0`, the
 * balance would sit over the action column at every scroll position and the
 * button could never be tapped.
 *
 * Opaque white — a pinned cell that is not lets the row slide through it — and
 * white rather than a tint because, unlike the register's cumulative block,
 * this is not a group of its own; it is the end of an ordinary table that
 * happens to stay put.
