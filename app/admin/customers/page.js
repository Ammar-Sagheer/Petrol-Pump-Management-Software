 * The bubble carries the customer's INITIALS. It has been a single letter, an
 * icon, and now two letters - see customer-avatar.js for why the icon version
 * did not survive contact with a long list.
 *
 * ONE CELL INSTEAD OF TWO COLUMNS. The vehicle used to be a column of its own,
 * which spent a whole column's width on a field that is blank for a good share
 * of customers and is only ever read as "which of the two Ahmads is this".
 * Sitting under the name it does that job better and gives the table one fewer
 * column to fit before it starts scrolling sideways - the same move the
 * Ramtabs reference makes with its vendor column.
