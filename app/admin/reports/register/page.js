/**
 * The Daily Sale & Stock Register.
 *
 * The owner keeps this as a spreadsheet - one row per trading day per tank,
 * with the running sales and the running gain/loss beside each other - and the
 * two cumulative columns are the whole point of it. A single day's variance is
 * a person squinting at a wet dipstick; ±30 L on a 5,000 L tank is the
 * measurement, not the fuel. A leak or a theft shows up as a cumulative
 * variance that walks in one direction and a percentage that will not come
 * back towards zero, and neither the Stock page (one day) nor Reports (one
 * whole month, one total) can show that.
 *
 * A PREVIEW, and it says so on the page. The owner asked for somewhere to
 * check the shape of this before it becomes a proper part of the app, so it is
 * reachable from Reports rather than from the sidebar, and the banner at the
 * top says what it is. Everything on it is real data through the same RLS and
 * the same role checks as every other page - "for testing" describes the
 * design, not the numbers.
 *
 * Rendered with Material UI at the owner's request. `RegisterTable` explains
 * why almost none of it is a Client Component despite that.
