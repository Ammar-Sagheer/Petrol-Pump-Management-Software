/**
 * Tells you when a nozzle's readings do not join up.
 *
 * A meter is continuous, so each reading's opening should equal the previous
 * reading's closing. Two things break that, and both quietly double-count:
 *
 *   BACK-FILLING - you missed the 3rd, entered the 4th, and are now going back.
 *   The 4th was saved with the 2nd's closing as its opening, so it already
 *   covers the 3rd's litres. Saving here counts them twice.
 *
 *   A GAP - the last reading for this nozzle is older than yesterday, so this
 *   entry silently covers several days rather than one.
 *
 * Warnings only. Meters really do get replaced or reset, and blocking the save
 * would trap someone with no way forward. The point is that it is never a
 * surprise afterwards.
