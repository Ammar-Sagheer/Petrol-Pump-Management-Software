/**
 * The headline figures at the top of a page.
 *
 * These are stat tiles rather than a chart on purpose: four single numbers with
 * no trend to show are read faster as text than as any plot.
 *
 * They stay WHITE. A dark slate strip was tried here to make the takings lead
 * the page - they are the first figure wanted each morning, and were the palest
 * thing on it - and the owner's verdict was that it looked bad. It did: a black
 * bar across the top of an otherwise light page reads as a toolbar or an error
 * state, not as a headline. Hierarchy on this page comes from the section order
 * and the size of the figures instead.

   * for four columns at the `lg` viewport breakpoint it gave each tile 192px,
   * and "Rs 4,386,211" at 24px needs more than that - the figures ran into
   * their own dividers. Measured against the grid itself, four columns wait
   * until there is genuinely room for them.
   *
   * The bottom end is the same problem from the other side: two tiles across
   * a 320px phone leaves about 130px each, where the number either broke
   * after the "Rs" - two lines that read for a moment as two figures - or ran
   * out of its tile. One per row until 24rem.
