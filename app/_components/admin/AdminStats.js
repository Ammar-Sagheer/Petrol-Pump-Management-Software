/**
 * What colour an icon ring wears, keyed by the icon's own name.
 *
 * FOUR COLOURS, AND EACH ONE MEANS SOMETHING. Green is money arriving,
 * amber is money owed or gone, red is something to look at, slate is
 * everything else. That is the whole vocabulary.
 *
 * It used to be seven hues - sky, cyan, violet, teal, indigo on top of these -
 * one per KIND of thing rather than per meaning: fuel blue, oil violet, stock
 * teal, banking indigo. It read as a rainbow rather than a palette, and the
 * colours were carrying nothing the icon and the label did not already say.
 * Worse, two of those hues were the fuels' own: a blue ring on "Litres sold"
 * and a violet one on "Oil sold" are exactly the colours petrol and lubricant
 * wear as identity elsewhere, so the ring quietly competed with the one cue
 * that has to stay unmistakable.
 *
 * The rule now: **colour a ring only when the colour adds meaning the icon
 * cannot.** A wallet icon already says "expenses"; the amber says "and this is
 * money leaving". A pump icon already says "fuel"; there is nothing left for a
 * colour to add, so it stays slate.
 *
 * `tone` remains a separate axis and still colours the figure itself and its
 * pill, so a bad month's profit is a red number in a green ring: the ring says
 * "this tile is about money coming in", the number says "and it went the wrong
 * way".
 *
 * NOT A FILLED RING ANY MORE - a small glyph beside the label, in the hue.
 * The Ramtabs reference the owner supplied sets its tiles that way: a quiet
 * outline icon sharing the label's line, with the card's colour spent on the
 * sparkline instead. It is the better trade for this app, and it also settled
 * a question the Argon pass had got stuck on.
 *
 * WHAT THE FILLED VERSION COST. Argon's rings are solid saturated circles.
 * That works for three of these four meanings and breaks on the fourth: money
 * owed is amber, and a saturated amber IS diesel. Measured rather than
 * eyeballed, `amber-600` is `#d97706` at hue 33 degrees, against diesel's own
 * swatch `#FB923C` at 27 and its accent rule `#C2410C` at 17. Six degrees is
 * not a distinction. Rendered, the "On credit" ring landed one section above a
 * diesel-accented card and was the loudest thing on a page where orange is
 * supposed to mean one specific fuel - exactly what docs/UI_CONVENTIONS.md ->
 * "Two palettes, and they never overlap" exists to prevent, and a safety rule
 * rather than a taste one. There is no step that is both solid and not orange;
 * `amber-700` is 25 degrees, nearer still.
 *
 * WHERE THE LINE ACTUALLY FALLS: AREA, NOT SIZE. A 16px outline glyph spends
 * so little of the hue that the question goes away - it is a stroke, and the
 * label beside it says "On credit" in words. A sparkline is not: 72x34px of
 * line plus fill is MORE amber than the 44px circle that was rejected, and
 * rendered directly above a diesel-accented card the two read as one colour
 * language. So the two get different maps.
 *
 * SPARK_COLORS may only be green, red or slate - the chrome colours no fuel
 * owns. Amber is the single chrome colour a fuel does own, so the money-owed
 * group draws its sparkline in neutral slate and keeps its amber on the glyph.
 * The tile does not lose the meaning; it stops shouting it in diesel's voice.

/**
 * The headline figures at the top of a page.
 *
 * These are stat tiles rather than a chart on purpose: four single numbers with
 * no trend to show are read faster as text than as any plot.
 *
 * They stay WHITE. A dark slate strip was tried here to make the takings lead
 * the page - they are the first figure wanted each morning, and were the palest
 * thing on it - and the owner's verdict was that it looked bad. It did: a black
 * bar across the top of an otherwise light page reads as a toolbar or an error
 * state, not as a headline. Hierarchy on this page comes from the section order
 * and the size of the figures instead.
 *
 * Each tile is its OWN raised card, not a cell in a shared grid. Individually
 * shadowed, gapped tiles read as separate figures to check off one at a time -
 * a single slab with hairline dividers read as one fused block, which is the
 * opposite of "four things to verify against the drawer". `sub` renders as a
 * small pill rather than plain text when the tile has a direction (`tone`
 * `positive`/`negative`) - the same information, just legible at a glance the
 * way a coloured tag is and a sentence is not.
 *
 * `icon` is optional and puts a small glyph beside the label, in the hue its
 * meaning carries (see ACCENT_COLORS). Left off, the tile is the same tile
 * without it; not every stat has an icon that means anything, so this is
 * opt-in. `accentTone` overrides the colour for a tile whose icon means
 * something different in context.
 *
 * `spark` is an optional array of numbers - the same figure over the last N
 * days - drawn as a sparkline to the right of the value. `sparkTips` is the
 * matching array of `{ v, d }` readouts, pre-formatted by the caller (see
 * Sparkline.js on why the formatting cannot happen in there), which is what
 * turns the line into something hoverable.
 *
 * `delta` is `{ current, previous, from, higherIsBetter }` and renders the
 * percent badge - see DeltaBadge.js, and note `higherIsBetter: false` on
 * anything where a rise is bad news. It sits ABOVE `sub`: the comparison is a
 * fact about the figure, `sub` is a description of it. It is DECORATION
 * WITH A SHAPE, not a second figure: no axis, no scale, no tooltip, and
 * aria-hidden, so nothing on it can be misread as a quantity. Pass it only
 * where a real series already exists; a tile with none simply has none, and
 * that is not a broken-looking tile.
 *
 * `iconNode` is the escape hatch for a one-off icon that isn't in the app's
 * own hand-drawn set (`Icon.js`) - currently only the Customers "Total
 * outstanding" tile, which uses a Material UI icon at the owner's request.
 * Pass a rendered node (already sized) instead of a name; `icon` is ignored
 * when this is set. Reach for `icon` first - this exists so one page can
 * differ without teaching the whole set about a package the rest of the app
 * does not use.
