/*
 * The whole card wears its fuel's colour, not just the badge.
 *
 * Two cards side by side, identical but for a small badge and a name, and the
 * figures typed into them are four-digit numbers that look alike - so petrol's
 * reading going into diesel's box is an easy slip and an expensive one, because
 * a dip is the baseline every later day is measured from.
 *
 * Same sky/amber families `FuelBadge` uses everywhere else, so this reinforces
 * an association the app has already taught rather than inventing a new one.
 * The colour is on the header band and border only - the body stays white so
 * the figures keep full contrast on a tablet in poor light.
 *
 * ONE BAND IS DARK AND ONE IS LIGHT, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE TRICK.
 *
 * This was got wrong once, so it is written down. Both headers were first made
 * dark - sky-800 against amber-800 - on the reasoning that a matched pair
 * differing only in hue would look like two tanks of equal standing, where a
 * dark card beside a pale one silently ranks them. The owner's verdict was
 * immediate: "they both look the same, both are dark."
 *
 * He was right and the reasoning was backwards. LIGHTNESS is the cue the eye
 * reads first and the one that survives poor light, a cheap screen and any
 * colour-vision deficiency; hue is the weaker, more fragile signal. Matching
 * the luminance of two things whose entire job is to be told apart destroys the
 * strongest difference available in order to buy a symmetry nobody asked for.
 * sky-800 and amber-800 sit at 0.089 and 0.098 - a 1.1x gap, which is to say
 * none. Petrol dark navy against diesel bright yellow is a 6.5x gap.
 *
 * Each band still carries its own text at better than AAA: white on sky-800 is
 * 7.6:1, ink-900 on amber-400 is 10.7:1.
 *
 * Colour is NOT the only cue and must not be. The tank name is large and bold
 * in the header, and the dip box's own label names the tank again - so the card
 * still reads correctly for anyone who cannot use the colours at all. The
 * FuelBadge that used to sit in the header is gone: on a band that is already
 * the fuel's colour, beside a name that already says "Petrol Tank", it repeated
 * a thing said twice and had no shade that contrasted with both bands.

 * A dip is a MOMENT, not a day, and which day it judges depends on when the rod

 * This pump dips first thing in the morning, before the pumps are switched on,

 * 10th - and has to be compared against the 10th's books. Recording it against

 * figure that still had the 10th's fuel in it and reported a whole day's sales
 * as a loss, every single day.

 * legal and only the person holding the rod knows which is right, so this
