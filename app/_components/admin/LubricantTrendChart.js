/**
 * Day by day, what the shelf took and what the drum took.
 *
 * Built to sit beside the fuel charts and be read the same way: same bar shape,
 * same axes, same compact tick format, rupees on the Y axis. Only the series
 * differ.
 *
 * STACKED, NOT SIDE BY SIDE. The two together are "what the oil side of the
 * business did today", and the owner wants that total as well as the split -
 * which a stack gives for free and paired bars do not. It is the same argument
 * CashCreditChart makes for cash and credit.
 *
 * The colours are the pair already validated for this app: brand green against
 * violet, which stays separable for red-green colour blindness where the
 * obvious green/amber does not. Reusing that pair rather than picking a third
 * scheme also means a green block means "the ordinary case" on every chart on
 * the page.
 *
 * PLOTTED IN RUPEES, deliberately. Litres would put 12 L off the shelf beside
 * 0.4 L out of the drum and render the drum as a flat line - and the drum's
 * litres are derived from a rate anyway, so they are the softer number. In
 * money the two are comparable, which is the whole reason to chart them
 * together.

/*
 * BOTH SERIES ARE LUBRICANT'S OWN COLOUR, one light and one dark.
 *
 * This was brand green for packed and violet for loose - two hues borrowed
 * from the chrome to separate two halves of ONE product. On a chart headed
 * "Oil sales" that is backwards: the reader's first question is which bar is
 * oil, and neither colour answered it. Gold does, and it is the colour
 * lubricant already wears on its badge and its stat-tile glyph.
 *
 * THE PAIR IS SEPARATED BY LIGHTNESS, NOT HUE - `#977B20` is lubricant's dark
 * relative and `#D4AF37` its vivid one, both already in fuel-colors.js. That
 * is deliberate: two hues would have been a second colour decision inside a
 * product that owns one, and a lightness step survives red-green colour
 * blindness where two hues of similar value do not. Stacked one on top of the
 * other in the same bar, a light block over a dark one reads as two parts of
 * a whole, which is what packed and loose are.
 *
 * The legend still names both, so the colour is never carrying it alone.
