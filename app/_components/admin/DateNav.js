 * the old Go button was costing.
 *
 * Anything passed as children joins the end of the button row. A page-level
 * action for the day on screen belongs on the same line as the day's controls,
 * sharing their height and baseline, rather than floating beside the block and

        date in the page description. Three quiet statements of the same fact,
        none of them dominant - and the owner lost track of which day he was
        entering, which is how a day's readings ended up on the wrong date.
        
        So: one banner, larger than anything else in the block, carrying the
        weekday (checkable against the day you have actually lived), the
        written date, and what that day is relative to today. Tinted whenever
        it is not today.
