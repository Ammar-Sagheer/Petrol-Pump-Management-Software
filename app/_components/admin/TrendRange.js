/**
 * How far back the dashboard charts look.
 *
 * FOUR FIXED WINDOWS RATHER THAN TWO DATE BOXES. The charts already end on the
 * day chosen by `<DateNav>` at the top of the page, so the only thing missing
 * was how far back from it to go — and asked as a from/to pair that is two
 * date pickers, four taps and a way to enter a range that is backwards or
 * empty. One tap, no invalid states, and the day the window ends on is still
 * whatever the rest of the dashboard is showing.
 *
 * The four are the questions actually asked of this pump: last week, the
 * fortnight the charts always showed, the month, the quarter. 90 days is the
 * longest a daily bar stays readable at this width — beyond that the bars are
 * hairlines and a month-by-month view would be the right answer instead.
 *
 * THE CURRENT WINDOW IS A `<span>`, NOT A LINK, the same rule as the dead
 * button in `<Pager>`: a link styled to look inert is still focusable and
 * still navigates, which sends the reader to the page they are already on.
