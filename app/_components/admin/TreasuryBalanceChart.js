/**
 * What went into the safe each day, what came out, and what it was left
 * holding.
 *
 * WHY ALL THREE ON ONE CHART. The safe's balance on its own is a line that
 * falls off a cliff and climbs back, and it never says why. The movements on
 * their own say why and never say whether the safe was nearly empty at the
 * time. On the owner's first eight days both matter at once: Rs 1.85m in the
 * safe on the 17th, an Rs 1.59m payment out the same day, Rs 187,920 left.
 * Read off two charts that is arithmetic; read off one it is a picture.
 *
 * THE BARS ARE MOVEMENTS AND THE LINE IS A LEVEL, and they are coloured to
 * say so. The two bars take the app's validated two-series pair - green and
 * violet, checked with the palette validator rather than picked by eye,
 * because green/amber does not separate for red-green colour blindness (see
 * CashCreditChart, which uses the same pair for the same reason). The balance
 * line is deliberately NOT a third hue: it is slate, the app's neutral, so it
 * reads as the thing the two coloured series add up to rather than as a third
 * kind of movement. That also keeps the chart to two decorative hues, which
 * is what "Two palettes, and they never overlap" in docs/UI_CONVENTIONS.md
 * asks of anything sharing a page with the fuels' own colours.
 *
 * ONE Y AXIS, because both are rupees. Two axes would let a small movement be
 * drawn taller than a large balance, which is the standard way a combined
 * chart lies.
 *
 * Everything on it is formatted here in the browser with Intl rather than by
 * helpers.js - that module reads request cookies and cannot enter a client
 * bundle. The pre-formatted-on-the-server rule applies to Sparkline's `tips`,
 * where the caller knows the unit and the component cannot; here the unit is
 * always rupees and always this component's own.
