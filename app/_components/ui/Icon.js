/**
 * The app's icons, drawn inline rather than pulled from a package.
 *
 * WHY NOT AN ICON LIBRARY. There are eleven icons in here. Lucide or Heroicons
 * would add a dependency and a bundle for that, and every icon in a library is
 * a decision someone else made about what a "tank" looks like. Drawing them
 * here keeps the set small, keeps them on the same 24px grid and the same
 * stroke weight, and means adding one is editing this file rather than
 * shopping.
 *
 * WHY ICONS AT ALL. The app was entirely text: ten identically-shaped nav tabs,
 * and statuses told apart by two letters and a colour. That asks the reader to
 * parse a word every time, and it leans on colour alone for the difference
 * between a nozzle that is done and one that is not - which is exactly what
 * fades in a dim pump office and what a red-green colourblind reader cannot
 * see. An icon beside the word gives a second, redundant cue: shape.
 *
 * They are decoration, never the only carrier of meaning - every icon here
 * sits next to its own label, and is aria-hidden so a screen reader is not
 * made to announce it twice.
 *
 * Everything is `currentColor` and 1.75 stroke, so an icon takes the colour and
 * the weight of the text it sits beside without being told.
